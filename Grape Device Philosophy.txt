 GRAPE TECHNOLOGIES' "SMARTPHONE" PHILOSOPHY.
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

The philosophy of ,and, Grape Technologies' definition of a Smartphone: That for a device to be termed a smart phone ,it reqiures to be of productively good use ;and, as of its main functions, that of being a mobile phone, that its now basic functions, that of calling and text messaging, be prioritized,to the greater extent,just as its "smart" functions,be re-prioritized, to continue the legacy, topmost, that of being an actual Personal Digital Assistant and Organizer, before that of a Phone's selling point.. That way, if there is ever a product that is a smartphone, it serves its due purpose to the benefit and the value of the end user.
This Philosophy,to some extent, also recognizes the attachment an end user may generate for a product of the kind that we sell, hence, it is our responsibility, as a producer, to develop, device longevity strategies, that will allow the end user to enjoy,the comfort of owning a device, for as long as the capabilities of the device remain relevant,to the extended benefit of the user.
In this Philosophy, we value your humanity, and the importance of the data that you daily produce yourself and since we aspire  that you make the connections you need to make,we are dedicated to protect your data, so that you can get the best out of a network without worrying about  your information as you go about shaping your world.
